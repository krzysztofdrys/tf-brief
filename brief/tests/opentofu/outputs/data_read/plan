OpenTofu will perform the following actions:

  # data.tfcoremock_simple_resource.read will be read during apply
  # (config refers to values not yet known)
 <= data "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "read" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.create will be created
  + resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "create" {
    }

  # module.create.local_file.data_file will be created
  + resource "local_file" "data_file" {
    }

  # module.create.random_integer.random will be created
  + resource "random_integer" "random" {
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
